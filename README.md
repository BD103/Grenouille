# Grenouille

A silly little frog that goes everywhere with you! :3

This is my attempt at making a small [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) "game" that is as portable as possible. My eventual goal is to run it on every single computer I own. The game is less of a game and more of a fun program that you can run to cheer you up. (The frog is really cute!)

## Installation

Uhhh... I'm still working on it right now. :P I'll fill this in soon.

## Todo

- [ ] Blinking frog
